### Overview of Quantization ###
Quantization reduces the precision of point cloud coordinates to compress data size. This is achieved by rounding coordinates to the nearest multiple of a given resolution.

### Key Parameters ###
1. **Resolution**:
   - Specifies the granularity of the quantized values (e.g., 0.001 for millimeter precision).
   - Higher resolution retains more detail but compresses less.
