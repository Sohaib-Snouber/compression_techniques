### Overview of Uniform/Random Sampling ###
Sampling simplifies the point cloud by selecting a subset of points. Uniform sampling selects points at regular intervals, preserving structure, while random sampling selects points randomly, suitable for unstructured data.

### Mathematical Concept ###
1. **Uniform Sampling**:
   - Uniform sampling selects every `n`th point from the dataset, where `n` is the sampling ratio.
   - Mathematically, the indices of selected points are:
       I = {i | i mod n == 0, i ∈ {0, 1, ..., N-1}}
     where N is the total number of points, and n is the uniform sampling ratio.
2. **Random Sampling**:
   - Random sampling selects a fixed percentage of points (`p`), chosen randomly.
   - Mathematically, a subset of size k = p * N is selected uniformly at random:
       S ⊆ {0, 1, ..., N-1}, |S| = k
     where N is the total number of points, and p is the random sampling ratio.
