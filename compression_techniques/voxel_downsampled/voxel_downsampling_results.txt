### Overview of Voxel Downsampling ###
Voxel downsampling is a geometric simplification technique that groups points within fixed-size 3D cubes (voxels) and replaces them with a representative point, typically the centroid. This method effectively reduces the number of points while retaining the overall structure of the point cloud.

### Key Features ###
1. **Simplification**: Reduces the number of points in dense areas.
2. **Efficiency**: Improves performance in tasks such as rendering, storage, and processing.
3. **Customizable Granularity**: The voxel size determines the level of detail retained.

### Mathematical Concept ###
1. **Voxel Indexing**: Each point in the cloud is assigned to a voxel based on its coordinates:
    Voxel_index = floor(Point_coordinate / Voxel_size)
2. **Representative Point**: The points within each voxel are replaced with a single point, such as the centroid:
    Centroid = mean(Points_in_voxel)
3. **Color Retention**: The color of the representative point is computed as the average color of all points in the voxel.
