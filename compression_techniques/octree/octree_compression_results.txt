### Overview of Octree Compression ###
Octree compression is a hierarchical representation method that divides a 3D space into smaller subspaces called octants. Starting with a root node representing the entire space, the method recursively subdivides each octant into eight smaller octants, stopping at a predefined depth. The depth determines the level of detail.

### Key Features ###
1. **Hierarchical Representation**: Efficiently represents 3D space in a tree structure.
2. **Compression**: Reduces point count by approximating multiple points within a voxel.
3. **Applications**: Commonly used in rendering, storage, and transmission of large 3D datasets.

### Mathematical Concept ###
Each node in the octree represents a voxel, defined by its origin and size. The mathematical basis involves:
  - **Subdivision**: Divide each voxel into eight smaller ones, represented by the formula:
    Voxel_center[i] = Voxel_origin + (i * Voxel_size / 2), for i in {0, ..., 7}
  - **Storage**: Store points in leaf nodes, which represent the smallest voxels.
  - **Reconstruction**: Use the center of each voxel or average of contained points for reconstruction.
