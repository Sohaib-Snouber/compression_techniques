### Overview of Plane Fitting (Region Growing) ###
Plane fitting is a segmentation technique to extract planar surfaces from point clouds. Using RANSAC, the algorithm iteratively estimates the parameters of a plane by minimizing the distance of inliers to the plane. Region growing can expand the segmented plane by clustering neighboring points with similar normals.

### Key Parameters ###
1. **Distance Threshold**:
   - Defines the maximum distance a point can have to the plane to be considered an inlier.
   - Smaller values: More precise plane fitting but fewer inliers.
   - Larger values: More inliers but risks over-segmentation.
2. **Number of Iterations**:
   - Higher values lead to better plane fitting but slower computation.
3. **Region Growing (Normal Similarity)**:
   - Clusters points based on proximity and similarity in normal vectors to expand planar regions.
